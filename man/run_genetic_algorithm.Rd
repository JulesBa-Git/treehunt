}
\arguments{
\item{patient_data}{A data.frame containing patient information with at least
a node column and a target column.}

\item{node_column}{Either a string (column name) or integer (column index, 1-based)
specifying the column containing node indexes. This column should be either:
\itemize{
  \item A list of integer vectors: \code{list(c(1,2), c(3), c(4,5))}
  \item A character vector with comma-separated values: \code{c("1,2", "3", "4,5")}
}}

\item{target_column}{Either a string (column name) or integer (column index, 1-based)
specifying the target/outcome column. Integer values are treated as binary,
numeric values with non-0/1 entries are treated as continuous.}

\item{tree_depth}{An integer vector specifying the depth of each node in the
tree structure. Must start at depth 1 and children must be at depth+1 of
their parent.}

\item{population_size}{Number of solutions in the population. Default: 100.}

\item{epochs}{Number of generations to evolve. Default: 1000.}

\item{mutation_rate}{Probability of mutating each offspring. Default: 0.1.}

\item{prob_mutation_type1}{When mutation occurs, probability of using Type 1
(add/remove) vs Type 2 (swap) mutation. Default: 0.2.}

\item{crossover_rate}{Probability of applying crossover to selected parents.
Default: 0.8.}

\item{elite_count}{Number of top solutions to preserve unchanged each generation.
Default: 0.}

\item{tournament_size}{Number of solutions competing in tournament selection.
Default: 2.}

\item{alpha}{Parameter controlling the add/remove mutation bias. Higher values
favor adding nodes. Default: 1.0.}

\item{score_type}{Scoring function to use. Either "hypergeometric" for the
hypergeometric test or "relative_risk" for relative risk calculation.
Default: "hypergeometric".}

\item{diversity}{If TRUE, applies a diversity penalty to encourage exploration
of different solutions. Default: FALSE.}

\item{verbose}{If TRUE, prints progress during the run. Default: FALSE.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{final_population}{The complete final population of solutions}
    \item{final_scores}{Scores for all solutions in the final population}
    \item{parameters}{List of parameters used for the run}
    \item{statistics}{Additional information about cache hits etc.}
  }
}
\description{
Performs a genetic algorithm search to find optimal node combinations that
maximize a specified score function. The algorithm evolves a population of
solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
}
\details{
The genetic algorithm uses the following operators:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Selection}: Tournament selection with configurable size
  \item \strong{Crossover}: Single-point crossover on tree subtrees
  \item \strong{Mutation Type 1}: Add or remove a node (probability controlled by alpha)
  \item \strong{Mutation Type 2}: Swap a node with its parent or child
  \item \strong{Elitism}: Top solutions preserved unchanged
}

The algorithm maintains a score cache to avoid redundant computations for
solutions that have been seen before (identified by hash).

When \code{diversity = TRUE}, solutions are penalized based on their similarity
to other solutions in the population, encouraging exploration of diverse regions.
