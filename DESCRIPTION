Description: Implements hybrid evolutionary Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and 
    genetic algorithm methods to search through hierarchical tree structures for 
    node combinations that optimize user-defined criteria. Originally developed 
    for pharmacovigilance applications to identify ATC (Anatomical Therapeutic 
    Chemical) code combinations maximizing relative risk, the package generalizes 
    to any tree hierarchy and optimization metric. Efficient C++ implementation 
    via 'Rcpp' enables exploration of large combinatorial spaces.
